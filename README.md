# FinWASM meetup website

You can view the [FinWASM event website online](https://colineberhardt.github.io/finwasm-smart-contract/).

This is a spoof event website, where the sign-up is managed via a smart contract, written using [AssemblyScript](https://docs.assemblyscript.org/), running on the [NEAR protocol](https://nearprotocol.com/) blockchain network.

## Development

To run this locally, you'll need to create a NEAR account - you can find details about how to sign up, and more information about smart contract development on my blog post, [WebAssembly on the Blockchain and JavaScript Smart Contracts](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2019/11/26/webassembly-on-the-blockchain.html).
